	Normal Game- The classic Snake game where the goal is to eat food to make the 
		     snake bigger. The larger your snake, the higher your score; however,
		     the game will also become more difficult as the snake becomes longer.
	  Wall Game- The normal Snake game with a twist: Every time you eat food, there 
		     is a wall created where the food was. This makes the game become
		     harder much faster as well as adds an extra key to use that will be 
		     discussed later.
	 Speed Game- The same as the Normal Game, except the snake gets faster after every 
		     piece of food eaten.
	Badass Game- Wall Game and Speed Game combined. 
		     WARNING: YOU WILL DIE. FAST.
